    "ai_summary": "## 1. Threat Summary\n\nA critical finding indicates the presence of an executable file disguised with a `.py` (Python script) extension. This is a clear attempt at **defense evasion** and **masquerading** to trick users or automated security tools into believing it's a harmless script, while its true nature is a malicious binary. The lack of VirusTotal or YARA matches suggests it could be a newly compiled, custom, or less common piece of malware. Its primary goal is likely **execution** on a victim's system, potentially via user interaction.\n\n## 2. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping\n\n*   **Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)**\n    *   T1036 - Masquerading\n        *   T1036.002 - Disguise File Type: The file's extension (`.py`) does not match its true executable file type, a common technique to evade detection or trick users.\n\n*   **Tactic: Execution (TA0002)**\n    *   T1204 - User Execution\n        *   T1204.002 - Malicious File: This technique describes an adversary relying on a user to execute a malicious file, which is highly probable given the disguised file type.\n\n**Actionable Intelligence:**\n\n*   **Containment & Eradication:** Immediately isolate and remove this specific file from any affected endpoints.\n*   **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct in-depth analysis (e.g., sandboxing, static analysis) of the executable to determine its true payload, capabilities, and indicators of compromise (IOCs).\n*   **Source Investigation:** Determine the origin of this file (e.g., email attachment, web download, internal share) to identify the initial compromise vector and potential spread.\n*   **Security Controls Review:** Evaluate endpoint detection and response (EDR) rules, file integrity monitoring, and email/web gateway policies to prevent similar masquerading attempts from succeeding.\n*   **User Awareness:** Reinforce security awareness training to educate users about suspicious file extensions and the dangers of executing unexpected files."
